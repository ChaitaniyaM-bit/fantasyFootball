This project works on an exploratory data analysis for the 2023 fantasy football season. In which I analyze the three crucial positons, QB, WR, and RB. 
I visualize the relationships between different statistics and the resulting fantasy points scored. I plan to leverage my findings when making decisions for my
2024 fantasy football draft. Future versions of this project include creating regression models from multiple prior years' data to help make intelligent decisions
for future drafts.
